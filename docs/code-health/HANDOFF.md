# Code health audit handoff

Audit date: 2026-07-31
Canonical repository: `/Users/justus/Developer/interior-ai`
Safety checkpoint: `08bdfe0c5e5c882777dc5da38168ea7db14840ad` on `safety/code-health-pre-audit-20260731`
Audit branch: `chore/code-health-audit-20260731`

## Outcome

The incoming 371-file working set was reviewed and preserved before audit work. No production behavior, source, catalog, schema, data, dependency, deployment, or remote system was changed. The repository was inventoried, architecture/import/history hotspots were measured, existing decisions and release documents were reconciled, focused and browser baselines were run, and a behavior-preserving modernization sequence was produced.

Created artifacts:

- `docs/code-health/00_SAFETY_AND_BASELINE.md`
- `docs/code-health/01_REPOSITORY_INVENTORY.md`
- `docs/code-health/02_CODE_HEALTH_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/code-health/03_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/code-health/04_REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/code-health/05_QUALITY_GATES_PLAN.md`
- `docs/code-health/HANDOFF.md`

## Inspected scope

- all 3,417 tracked files classified by role, with initial unknowns resolved;
- app/API routes, authentication/admin, persistence, quotas, sharing, events, integrations, health, and workflow transitions;
- canonical design/editor, 2D/3D scene, floor-plan import/compiler/publication, cabinetry, catalog/materials, commerce, exports, and accessibility overlays;
- TypeScript import graph, client/server boundary scan, function/component/file sizes, direct test references, and repository change history;
- package/lock/toolchain, Next/TypeScript/ESLint/Prisma/Playwright configuration and GitHub workflows;
- 42 migrations, generated sources, catalog YAML, binary/vendor assets, ignored/local outputs, and current/historical architecture/product/release documentation;
- delegated read-only frontend/scene, backend/security, and tooling/catalog/test audits, consolidated under stable CH IDs.

## Current baseline

Passes include typecheck, Prisma validation, design persistence, phase 7 security boundaries, the full required floor-plan umbrella, omitted-but-important floor-plan live progress, full cabinetry verification, editor accessibility/capability checks, generated surface drift/schema checks, strict asset inventory, catalog asset availability (with five draft missing-GLB warnings), theme contrast, optimized build, and two-case runtime smoke.

Known red checks:

- lint: one error and one warning under CI’s zero-warning policy;
- design cleanup: stale/failed command-bar save-status assertion;
- design architecture: two size ratchets exceeded;
- catalog audit: five invalid values across three Hamilton sofa YAML files;
- Phase 8: cold fingerprint p95 11.218 ms versus 6 ms budget; independent bundle measurement is also above current raw/Brotli budgets;
- Pro visual policy: Cabinet Preview opener hidden in Chromium and WebKit (2 pass, 2 fail);
- build is successful but catalog validation is lenient and Turbopack reports whole-project tracing risk.

Complete Playwright baseline: **FAIL — 183 passed, 29 failed, 13 did not run in 1.5 hours** across 225 cases with one worker. Artifacts are in `/private/tmp/code-health-e2e-full`. Twenty cabinetry failures and the Pro visual failure share a hidden `open-custom-millwork-studio` prerequisite; three failures expose 30 px touch targets; two are catalog drawer-name mismatches despite passing live-API data tests; one multi-room serial timeout suppresses 13 cases; one wall-orbit selection case fails; and the final paint case is infrastructure-contaminated by `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` after port 3000 stops listening.

The complete run stopped the local port 3000 listener that existed before the audit. It was restored after the run.

The exact command/result matrix is in `00_SAFETY_AND_BASELINE.md`; proposed required/risk/preview/release cadence is in `05_QUALITY_GATES_PLAN.md`.

## Highest risks

1. CH-0001: missing/unknown deployment classification can grant broad admin/Pro access.
2. CH-0002: caller-minted guest IDs bypass storage limits; quota create/merge paths are non-atomic.
3. CH-0007/CH-0008: catalog identities/sources disagree and publication status fails open.
4. CH-0012: saved-design entry points open a lossy legacy editor instead of the canonical document path.
5. CH-0016/CH-0017: CI tests lenient/dev behavior and some release tests can pass without exercising assertions.
6. CH-0018: migration gate proves a fresh database, not a populated predecessor upgrade.
7. CH-0013/CH-0014: oversized generated surface payload and per-item 3D resource/event ownership threaten scale.
8. CH-0015: drawers/dialogs expose invisible focus targets and inconsistent modal semantics.

No P0, direct SQL injection, obvious core-design IDOR, or runtime import cycle was confirmed.

## First READY implementation batch

CH-0001 is READY after confirming the deployment variable inventory. It is a narrow fail-closed security change with no product-policy dependency.

Expected files:

- `lib/config.ts`
- `lib/admin.ts`
- `scripts/test-auth-env-hardening.ts`
- `package.json`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Entry, exact behavior, verification commands, exit criteria, and rollback are specified in Phase 1 of `04_REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md`. Correctly configured production behavior remains unchanged; only accidental privilege through missing/invalid classification is removed.

Phase 0 baseline-restoration batches can proceed in parallel only after product confirms the intended command-bar save chip and Cabinet Preview visibility. Do not weaken the tests or raise budgets merely to turn the baseline green.

## Decisions required

- guest retention, quota/overage, and distributed rate budgets;
- floor-plan emergency retirement role;
- canonical catalog authoring source/status and treatment of 73 unspecified entries;
- whether Shopify is intentionally dormant;
- automatic share enabling and permanent revocation UX;
- PostHog replay consent/masking/legal basis;
- command-bar and Cabinet Preview intended behavior;
- external deep-readiness monitoring migration;
- formatter adoption.

## Resume instructions

1. Confirm branch and status; do not edit an RC/evidence copy.
2. Read all seven code-health documents and the finding IDs for the selected batch.
3. Reconfirm the port 3000 process working directory before editing the running application.
4. Record the product/operations decision if the finding requires one.
5. Implement one batch with characterization first and the rollback boundary described in the roadmap.
6. Use focused checks during iteration, immutable preview smoke after related fixes, and full Gate A3 only on the final promotion artifact.

No push, deployment, pull request, production database action, or stable-staging promotion has been performed.

## Final repository and listener status

The audit document set is the only intended change on `chore/code-health-audit-20260731`; its local commit SHA and the verified post-commit worktree status are reported in the final response. The local application is restored on port 3000 as Node PID 24923. `lsof` confirms its cwd is `/Users/justus/Developer/interior-ai`, and the deep health endpoint returns HTTP 200.
